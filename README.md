## What is Doctrine?

The Doctrine Project is the home of a selected set of PHP libraries primarily focused on providing persistence
services and related functionality. Its prize projects are a Object Relational Mapper and the Database Abstraction
Layer it is built on top of. You can read more about the projects below or view a list of all projects.

Object relational mapper (ORM) for PHP that sits on top of a powerful database abstraction layer (DBAL).
One of its key features is the option to write database queries in a proprietary object oriented SQL dialect
called Doctrine Query Language (DQL), inspired by Hibernates HQL. This provides developers with a powerful
alternative to SQL that maintains flexibility without requiring unnecessary code duplication.

DBAL is a powerful database abstraction layer with many features for database schema introspection,
schema management and PDO abstraction.
