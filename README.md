# Doctrine Bundle

Doctrine DBAL & ORM Bundle for the Symfony Framework.

Because Symfony 2 does not want to force or suggest a specific persistence solutions on the users
this bundle was removed from the core of the Symfony 2 framework. Doctrine2 will still be a major player
in the Symfony world and the bundle is maintained by developers in the Doctrine and Symfony communities.

    IMPORTANT: This bundle is developed for Symfony 2.1 and up. For Symfony 2.0 applications the DoctrineBundle
    is still shipped with the core Symfony repository.

## What is Doctrine?

The Doctrine Project is the home of a selected set of PHP libraries primarily focused on providing persistence
services and related functionality. Its prize projects are a Object Relational Mapper and the Database Abstraction
Layer it is built on top of. You can read more about the projects below or view a list of all projects.

Object relational mapper (ORM) for PHP that sits on top of a powerful database abstraction layer (DBAL).
One of its key features is the option to write database queries in a proprietary object oriented SQL dialect
called Doctrine Query Language (DQL), inspired by Hibernates HQL. This provides developers with a powerful
alternative to SQL that maintains flexibility without requiring unnecessary code duplication.

DBAL is a powerful database abstraction layer with many features for database schema introspection,
schema management and PDO abstraction.
