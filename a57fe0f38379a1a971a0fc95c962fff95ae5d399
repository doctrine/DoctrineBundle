Could you provide a test that reproduces this error ?

just my two cents: referring to the [Symfony coding standards](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html) there shouldn't be a space in the if between the opening bracket and the content. Imho it's really unaesthetic

Hey @ste93cry !
That comes from current code style in this [file](https://github.com/alsma-magecore/DoctrineBundle/blob/master/DataCollector/DoctrineDataCollector.php#L112)

Hey @kimhemsoe !

Added test, but it's not clear from test why metadata factory contains duplicates... Any idea how to clarify ?

You're correct about the code style, anyway imho it's the file that's not correct. There shouldn't be spaces there, so probably I would fix the codestyle of the entire file following the Symfony standards. Obviously, this is out of the scope of this issue, my comment was just an opinion on the commit.

Ok, thanks! I also was surprised, but decided to follow style from **master**

the CS issue is because the Doctrine coding standards are asking for a space around the negation in conditions. And recent changes in the bundle have been made by some people used to the Doctrine codebase
