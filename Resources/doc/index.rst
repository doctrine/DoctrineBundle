DoctrineBundle
==============

Doctrine DBAL & ORM Bundle for the Symfony Framework.

Symfony does not force or suggest a specific persistence solution on its users.
That's why this bundle was removed from the core of the Symfony framework and
moved into an independent repository.

Since Doctrine2 will still be a major player in the Symfony world, the bundle is
actively maintained by developers in the Doctrine and Symfony communities.
