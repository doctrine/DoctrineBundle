On hold until https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/pull/1543 is merged and a new version is released

@WouterJ doctrine/doctrine2#1543 was merged and is now part of 2.5.2. So, this can be pushed forward again, right?

Currently waiting for Security ACL 3.0.0-BETA1 to be released (seems to be forgotten).

@WouterJ I sent a pull request to make symfony/security-acl an optional dependency to the cache bundle: https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineCacheBundle/issues/76

Tests are green now, ready to be merged.
